# SgmlReader - Convert (almost) any HTML to valid XML

SgmlReader is a versatile C# .NET library written by Chris Lovett for parsing 
HTML/SGML files using the XmlReader API. A command line utility is also provided 
which outputs the well formed XML result. The original community around 
SgmlReader was hosted by 
<strike>[GotDotNet](http://www.gotdotnet.com/Community/UserSamples/Details.aspx?SampleGuid=B90FDDCE-E60D-43F8-A5C4-C3BD760564BC)</strike>,
but this site was phased out. An archived version of the original release is 
still available in the [MSDN Code Gallery](http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/SgmlReader).

[MindTouch](http://mindtouch.com) uses the SgmlReader library extensively.  Over 
the last few years we have made many improvements to it.  In the spirit 
of the original author, we're providing back these changes in our 
[GitHub SgmlReader repository](https://github.com/MindTouch/SGMLReader).

## SgmlReaderDll API

The SgmlReader is an implementation of the XmlReader API. So the only thing you 
really need to know is how to construct it. SgmlReader has a default constructor, 
then you need to set some of the properties. To load a DTD you must specify 
DocType="HTML" or you must provide a SystemLiteral. To specify the SGML 
document you must provide either the InputStream or Href. Everything else is 
optional. Then you can read from this reader like any other XmlReader class.

### Sample Usage

    XmlDocument FromHtml(TextReader reader) {
    
        // setup SgmlReader
        Sgml.SgmlReader sgmlReader = new Sgml.SgmlReader();
        sgmlReader.DocType = "HTML";
        sgmlReader.WhitespaceHandling = WhitespaceHandling.All;
        sgmlReader.CaseFolding = Sgml.CaseFolding.ToLower;
        sgmlReader.InputStream = reader;
    
        // create document
        XmlDocument doc = new XmlDocument();
        doc.PreserveWhitespace = true;
        doc.XmlResolver = null;
        doc.Load(sgmlReader);
        return doc;
    }

### SgmlReader Properties

* **SgmlDtd Dtd**<br/>
Specify the SgmlDtd object directly. This allows you to cache the Dtd and share 
it across multipl SgmlReaders. To load a DTD from a URL use the SystemLiteral 
property.
* **string DocType**<br/>
The name of root element specified in the DOCTYPE tag. If you specify "HTML" 
then the SgmlReader will use the built-in HTML DTD. In this case you do not need 
to specify the SystemLiteral property.
* **string PublicIdentifier**<br/>
The PUBLIC identifier in the DOCTYPE tag. This is optional.
* **string SystemLiteral**<br/>
The SYSTEM literal in the DOCTYPE tag identifying the location of the DTD.
* **string InternalSubset**<br/>
The DTD internal subset in the DOCTYPE tag. This is optional.
* **TextReader InputStream**<br/>
The input stream containing SGML data to parse. You must specify this property 
or the Href property before calling Read().
* **string Href**<br/>
Specify the location of the input SGML document as a URL.
* **string WebProxy**<br/>
Sometimes you need to specify a proxy server in order to load data via HTTP from 
outside the firewall. For example: "itgproxy:80".
* **string BaseUri**<br/>
The base Uri is used to resolve relative Uri's like the SystemLiteral and Href 
properties.
* **TextWriter ErrorLog**<br/>
DTD validation errors are written to this stream.
* **string ErrorLogFile**<br/>
DTD validation errors are written to this log file.

## SgmlReader.exe Command Line Tool

### Usage

The command line executable version has the following options:

    sgmlreader <options> [InputUri] [OutputFile]

* -e "file" : Specifies a file to write error output to.  The default is to 
generate no errors.  The special name "$stderr" redirects errors to stderr 
output stream.
* -proxy : "server"  Specifies the proxy server to use to fetch DTD's through 
the fire wall.
* -html : Specifies that the input is HTML.
* -dtd "uri" : Specifies some other SGML DTD.
* -base : Add an HTML base tag to the output.
* -pretty : Pretty print the output.
* -encoding name : Specify an encoding for the output file (default UTF-8)
* -noxml : Stops generation of XML declaration in output.
* -doctype : Copy <!DOCTYPE tag to the output.
* InputUri : The input file name or URL. Default is stdin.  If this is a local 
file name then it also supports wildcards.
* OutputFile : The optional output file name. Default is stdout.  If the 
InputUri contains wildcards then this just specifies the output file extension, 
the default being ".xml".

### Examples

Converts all .htm files to corresponding .xml files using the built in HTML DTD.

    sgmlreader -html *.htm *.xml

Converts all the MSN home page to XML storing the result in the local file 
"msn.xml".

    sgmlreader -html http://www.msn.com -proxy myproxy:80 msn.xml

Converts the given OFX file to XML using the SGML DTD "ofx160.dtd" specified in 
the test.ofx file.

    sgmlreader -dtd ofx160.dtd test.ofx ofx.xml

(unless you specify the new -noxml option) and any existing xml declarations in 
the input are stipped out so you don't end up with two.
* Added support for ASP &lt;%...%> blocks (thanks to Dan Whalin).
* Now strips out DOCTYPE by default since HTML DocTypes can cause problems for 
XmlDocument when it tries to load the HTML DTD.  but added "-doctype" switch for 
those who really need it to come through.
